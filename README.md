# Project Overview

Using ROS, a TurtleBot was programmed in C++ to identify a red, rubber ball,
then track and follow the ball while staying approximately one meter away
whenever possible. The object identification and tracking was performed
using OpenCV. A demonstration of the project can be seen at the link
below.
